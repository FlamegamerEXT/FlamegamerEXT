👋 Hi, I’m Matthew McCabe, also known as @FlamegamerEXT
👀 I’m interested in Simulations, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Calculus and Algebra, as well as playing games and enjoying university life!
🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science, Maths, and Data Science at Victoria University of Wellington
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make use of mathematical concepts.

## A bit of context for the commits over the Summer of 2021/22:
Over the summer, I participated in the Advent of Code 2021. The Advent of Code gave programming challenges for the first 25 days of December, each with a varying set of skills and of increasing difficulty. I managed to complete the first 17 days’ challenges, which is something that I’m rather pleased with.
After the Advent of Code, I took the opportunity to work on some programs that I wouldn’t normally make during my university study. I decided to make some programs that implemented some concepts I learnt from reading articles and watching videos on YouTube. These concepts include:
•	Perlin noise, which is a field of random values that are correlated when close on the XY plane, but further away appear to be purely random. Perlin noise can be used to simulate more organic motion such as a flow field, or just be observed in its raw state.
•	Marching Squares, used to display a contour line in three-dimensional space, typically when the value on the Z-axis is a function of the X and Y values. An example of this would be visualising Perlin noise, or simulating waves ripple across a simulated plane, but I have also used Marching Squares to create Metaballs (which look a lot like the blobs within lava lamps).
•	Displaying three-dimensional points in two dimensions to simulate depth and parallax effect. This works by making the points’ size and the edges’ stroke weight to both be proportional to the inverse of the depth (Z-value). This is implemented in my Polyhedron Visualiser, which can display various polyhedrons and is able to translate and rotate the points that make up the polyhedron, and can also display them with edges and faces generated by the program.
Another program I created was a Minesweeper program that has an ‘AI solver’ that simulates all the different possible outcomes for the current board state and gives an indication of how safe it thinks each uncovered tile is. I have optimised the performance of the solver somewhat, but I would like to improve it further to reduce the number of unnecessary simulations created (i.e. simulations of impossible outcomes should be terminated as soon as possible).
